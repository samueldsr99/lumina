# Typography

Font tokens, text variants, and semantic tokens ensure typographic consistency and clarity, making design scalable and maintainable. They adhere to brand guidelines and enhance usability by providing clear typographic cues that aid user navigation and understanding.

This standardization simplifies the design process and ensures a unified user experience.

## Font Tokens (Primitives)

Font tokens define the core typography styles such as font family, size, weight, and line height, ensuring typographic consistency across the design system. They simplify the application of typography, making it easy to maintain a cohesive visual identity. These primitives serve as the foundational elements for all text-related design.

## Text Variants & Semantic Tokens

Text variants are predefined styles for specific text uses like headings, body text, and captions, ensuring design consistency.

Semantic tokens provide context by associating text styles with functions or statuses, such as errors or success messages. Together, they enhance clarity and usability by standardizing how text communicates different purposes.
